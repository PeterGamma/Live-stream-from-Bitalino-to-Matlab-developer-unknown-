no conversion from Garmin .fit file format to csv necessary. To my knowledge, nobody has demonstrated to do it by an automatic script procedure to this date.

Live streaming from Garmin devices is for developers. There are little practical examples which demonstrates a working live stream from a Gamin watch.

5. BItalino as a reference device to test the accuracy of sport watches:
