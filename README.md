Bitalino offers real time recording to csv format

no conversion from Garmin .fit file format to csv necessary. To my knowledge, nobody has demonstrated to do it by an automatic script procedure to this date.

Since live streaming from Garmin devices is not developed, Bitalino devices become very attractive. Instead of a Garmin foot pod, use a Bitalino foot pod

There is already an example in Matlab for step counting with the Beagle Bone Blue, which could also work as a real-time foot pod:

But you probably need to have installed both Beagle Bone BLue and Software, before all links are working >:(
