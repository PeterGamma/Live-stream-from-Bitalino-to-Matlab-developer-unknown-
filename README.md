Why is a live stream from a Garmin watch to Matlab or Python so complicated

and with a Bitalino Biomedcal Toolkit so simple?

Bitalino HeartBIT BT with direct bluetooth paring to Matlab is 190 Euros:

no GPS, no Footpod, but low-cost and simple.

Bitalino offers real time recording to csv format

no conversion from intransparent Garmin .fit file format to csv, which is so complicated, that to my knowledge, nobody has demonstrated to do it by an automatic script procedure to this date.

Bluetooth 3.0 pairing allows pairing only to one device at a time.

There is a Bitalino Open Signals Mobile app,  which should eventually work for real time csv recording. For a second real time stream to Matlab or Python, a second device is needed.

Bitalino can also be bought in parts. Batteries and electrodes can be bought from 3 th party sellers, and can be soldered to the Bitalino board. A Bitalino Core with housing is ca 90 USD plus 10 USD battery and 10 USD ECG electrode from 3 th party seller gives a total fo ca 110 USD per device.

Bitalino uses Bluetooth or BLE soft- and hardware, Garmin uses ANT+ hardware. There is hardly any ANT+ live stream desktop applications available.
