Why is a live stream from a Garmin watch to Matlab or Python so complicated

and with a Bitalino Biomedcal Toolkit so simple?

Bitalino HeartBIT BT with direct bluetooth paring to Matlab is 190 Euros:

no GPS, no Footpod, but low-cost and simple.

Bitalino offers real time recording to csv format

no conversion from intransparent Garmin .fit file format to csv, which is so complicated, that to my knowledge, nobody has demonstrated to do it by an automatic script procedure to this date.
